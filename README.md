# ðŸŒŸ Starr-Apps-Tools: Media Management Companions

Welcome to my collection of Starr-Apps-Tools, where I've carefully curated a set of scripts and tools to boost my *arr experience.

This repository contains an array of powerful tools I've crafted to do various tasks with my *arr suite (Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr, and etc). From managing duplicates to rescuing lost movies, I've got some decent stuff here.

## What's in the Toolbox?

- Phasarr: My solution for eliminating duplicates between Plex, Sonarr, and Radarr
- Radarr Missing Movie Search: Periodic missing movie searching in batches
- Queue & Invalid Item Cleaners: Get rid of those warnings about movies or series being removed from a metadata provider
- Backup & Restore Scripts: Running postgres? Don't get caught with your pants down. Use my scripts to backup & restore
- Docker Compose: I've got a lot going here. Feel free to use what you want!

I've designed these tools to simplify my media management. Feel free to explore, use, and adapt these tools for your own media setup. 

Happy streaming! ðŸš€
