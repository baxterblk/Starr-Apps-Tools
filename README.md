# ðŸŒŸ Starr-Apps-Tools: Media Management Companions

Welcome to my collection of Starr-Apps-Tools, where I've carefully curated a set of scripts and tools to boost my *arr experience.

This repository contains an array of powerful tools I've crafted to supercharge my *arr suite (Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr, and etc). From managing duplicates to rescuing lost movies, I've got it all covered.

## What's in the Toolbox?

- Phasarr: My solution for eliminating duplicates
- Radarr Missing Movie Search: Ensuring no film is left behind in my collection
- Queue & Invalid Item Cleaners: Keeping my media library organized
- Backup & Restore Scripts: Safeguarding my data
- Docker Compose: Streamlining my media stack deployment

I've designed these tools to simplify my media management. Feel free to explore, use, and adapt these tools for your own media setup. 

Happy streaming! ðŸš€
